/* Business Problem: How can we increase revenue? */

/* We've found that VIP customers bring the highest revenue concentration and hightest average order value. 
Our target is to find where we can make effort to increase customer retention in order to increase revenue.

In this section of SQL, we find out the following:
	1. How many customers are leaving within 1yr of making their first order
	2. Whether there are any Regular customers that could potentially become VIP
	3. How sales from VIP customers is doing

 -- PROBLEM: In 2014, there were no orders made by VIP customers. For the subquery, I first did aggregations to get year, month, total_orders and total sales from CTE_customer_data using GROUP BY. However, SQL excluded 2014 from the results. 
 -- SOLUTION: To get results for all years (2010-2014) I made a CTE table of years and months of the customer orders, and with it I did a LEFT JOIN to the customer data CTE. This way, no year would be excluded from the results

-- 5 Month Moving Average

		AND c.customer_segment = 'VIP' -- filters
	GROUP BY t.year, t.month)t
WHERE year NOT IN (2010, 2014)
ORDER BY t.year, t.month

-- Aim: Retain VIP customers and keep sales high and steady as they were in 2013 into the new year
-- MICROSOFT EXCEL: Looking a the Year-on-Year VIP performance, sales were good in 2011, dropped in 2012 and increased again in 2013. Sales should be kept at the level it was in 2013. 
-- Recommendations: Looking at the Month-on-Month VIP performance, sales are highest during summer months. To ensure sales are kept this way, I recommend offering premium service including exclusive access to new bikes and fast delivery option
